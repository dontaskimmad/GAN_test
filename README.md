# GAN_test
Test of GAN to generate numbers using MNIST DB

A Generative Adversarial Network that learns how to create digits by training against a neural network which is, in turn, training against the MNIST database.

On almost all runs it was interesting to note that there seemed to be a much higher prevelance of 0s, 7s and 9s generated, which could be a fault with the GAN.

Below is a sample run across 150 epochs.
